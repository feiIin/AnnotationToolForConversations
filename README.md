# Annotation Tool For Conversations
This annotation tool offers the possibility to annotate the intent for each turn of conversation.
It takes a txt file as input and and the output is given as txt file.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/feiIin/AnnotationToolForConversations.git
```

## Run the application
Run `gui.py` to start the application.

## Future works:
- Output as both txt and JSON file;
- Go back to annotate again previous turn in the conversation;
- Display the label/tag definition;

### The work is currently in progress
